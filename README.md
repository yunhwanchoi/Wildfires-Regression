# Tuning and Comparing Regression Models on Wildfires Dataset

The following walks through a step by step model-tuning/model-selection process on provided training and test datasets **wildfires_train.csv** and **wildfires_test.csv**. I built various candidate models using tree-based regression algorithms and linear regression on **wildfires_train.csv**. Candidate models were evaluated on a provided test set **wildfires_test.csv**.

The analysis and full code can be found [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/yunhwanchoi/Wildfires-Regression/blob/main/Tuning%20and%20Comparing%20Models%20on%20Wildfires%20Dataset.ipynb).

This analysis was taken from my lab assignment from *STAT 301-3: Data Science III* at Northwestern University.
